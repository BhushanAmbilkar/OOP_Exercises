# OOP Exercise 8: Determine if School_bus is also an instance of the Vehicle class

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, mileage, capacity):
        self.name = name
        self.mileage = mileage
        self.capacity = capacity

class Bus(Vehicle):
    pass

School_bus = Bus("School Volvo", 12, 50)

# Show Hint
# Use isinstance() function

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, mileage, capacity):
        self.name = name
        self.mileage = mileage
        self.capacity = capacity

class Bus(Vehicle):
    pass

School_bus = Bus("School Volvo", 12, 50)

# Python's built-in isinstance() function
print(isinstance(School_bus, Vehicle))
